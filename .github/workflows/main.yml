# This is a GitHub Actions workflow file.
# It automatically builds a .exe from your Python script and uploads it
# as an asset to any new "Release" you create on GitHub.

name: Build and Release EXE

# Trigger this workflow on every push to the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    # Use a Windows runner because we are building a .exe

    steps:
      # 1. Check out your repository's code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Set up a Python environment
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11' # You can change this version if needed

      # 3. Install your script's dependencies and PyInstaller
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install pyinstaller

      # 4. Run PyInstaller to build the .exe
      #    --onefile: Bundles everything into a single executable
      #    --windowed: Prevents the black console window from opening
      #    --name: Sets the final name of your .exe file
      #    --hidden-import: Ensures specific libraries are bundled
      - name: Build executable
        run: >
          pyinstaller 
          --onefile 
          --windowed
